## Initial release

An sbt plugin to interface a new close cousin of [implict.ly][imply], [ls.implicit.y][site], a effort to create a community sourced
catalog of discoverable and easily installable scala libraries. 

### How does it work?

There is a lot of useful information encoded within your sbt projects right now.

Unfortuanlly to access it someone has to:

- already have your library installed
- enjoy hunting it down in source code
- enjoy hunting it down in (hopefully) well written documentation

Nonsense!

[ls][site] is a service for synchronizing that information from github and making it discoverable via an api.

[ls-sbt][gh] is a client for that service that operates from within sbt.

### How do you get started?

[ls-sbt][gh] is a plugin. So you have to install it first

You can either append to your `project/plugins.sbt` file

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "ls-sbt" % "0.1.0")
    
    resolvers ++= Seq(
      "lessis" at "http://repo.lessis.me",
      "coda" at "http://repo.codahale.com"  
    )

or just use the convenient [conscript](https://github.com/n8han/conscript#readme) provided

    # install the conscript
    $ cs softprops/ls
    
    # run the conscript app in the root of your project
    $ lsinit

The conscript usage is recommended, as it will always install the [latest version of ls-sbt](http://ls.implicit.ly/api/1/latest/ls-sbt).
    
Next, mix in `lsSettings` to your build definition

    seq(lsSettings: _*)

Checkout the [docs on the site][pub] for more information.


### How do you use it?

The following is a brief list of common tasks and commands `lsSettings` adds to your project

    ls-write-version  # writes our the descriptor that ls synchronizes information with
    lsync             # once you've commited your versions metadata to github, syncronize it with ls using this command (no auth required)
    ls <term> <term>  # searches for ls-synced scala libraries based on keywords 
    ls-try <name>     # transiently installs a library by name
    ls-install <name> # persists an installation of a library by name
    
Examples

    # find libraries tagged with sbt
    ls sbt

    # install the latest version of unfiltered
    ls-install unfiltered
    
    # install a target version of unfiltered
    ls-install unfiltered@0.5.1
    
### I am looking at you

In order to actually make this service useful, just like [implicit.ly][imply], you have to actively sync your library info with ls.
