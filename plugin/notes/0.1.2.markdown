### Improvements

* Use a proper json serializer. Previously the metadata captured by ls was combined with simple string munging. The use of a proper serializer will ensure the ls server will be able to parse this information.

### Changes to defaults

* Changed the default external resolver configured for libraries from `ScalaToolsReleases` to `Opts.releases.sonatypeReleases`. This setting determines which resolver to configure when using the `ls-install` and `ls-try` commands and functions as an hint to ls that this is a default

### New task settings

* New `ls-lint` task to verify your `src/main/ls/:version.json` file is up to spec. Since these files are hand editable json. You are free to modify their contents. `ls-lint` will let you know if your changes are currently compatible with the expected format.
* New `ls-cat` task to print your version file to the console. This makes quickly inspecting that the metadata that `ls-write` extracts and writes is the data you want publishes.

### Dependencies

* Temporarily switching to lift-json instead of jackson for json parsing due to long standing non-deterministic class loader/pickled sig issue
